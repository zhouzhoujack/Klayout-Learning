  <keyword name="Selection"/>

  <p>
  The basic entity that some operations work with is the "selection". This is basically a set
  of shapes of instances on which an operation should be applied.
  A selection can be established by either clicking on a element in "Select" mode or by
  dragging a selection rectangle. When the mouse is released, all elements inside the selection
  rectangle are selected.

  <p>
  The selection set can be modified by adding elements (press the Shift button in addition to 
  selecting elements), by removing elements (press Ctrl in addition) or by toggling the selecting
  (press Shift and Ctrl in addition: remove already selected ones and add new ones).
