  <title>Organizing Layers Hierarchically</title>
  <keyword name="Layer groups"/>

  <p>
  Layers can be organized hierarchically. For example, certain layers can 
  be grouped together. Choose "Group" in the context menu of the layer
  list (right-click the layer list). The selected layers will be replaced
  by a tree node that represents these layers. Click on the tree node to
  expand or collapse this group.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once layers are grouped, they can be hidden or made visible with a single
  double-click on the node representative. The node representative also
  controls the appearance of the layers in the group: if a color or style
  is assigned to the representative, it overrides the respective style
  of all layers contained in the group. This way for example, the color of the layers
  contained in the group can be changed at once. To remove a color override
  of a node representative, set the color to "None". 
  </p>

  <p>
  To resolve a group, select the group representative and choose "Ungroup" from
  the context menu. 
  </p>

  <p>
  A variety of automatic grouping methods is provided. For example,
  the "Regroup views by layout index" from the layer context menu will collect all
  layers and put them into one group per layout shown in the panel.
