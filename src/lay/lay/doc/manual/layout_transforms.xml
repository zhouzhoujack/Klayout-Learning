  <p>
  Some functions are available to transform a whole layout. Whole-layout 
  transformations are applied to all cells in a way that every cell will 
  be modified in the same way. This feature is specifically useful for scaling
  layouts. It is worth noting that scaling a layout this way does not produce
  instances with magnifications.

  <p>
  The layout transformation functions are available in "Edit/Layout" (flip, rotate, scale, move).
