  <title>Layer Sizing</title>
  <keyword name="Layer operations"/>
  <keyword name="Size operation"/>

  <p>
  A sizing operation allows growing or shrinking of the shapes of a layer by a given offset, which is applied per edge. 
  Positive values will enlarge the shapes while negative values will shrink the shapes. 
  The offset can be given separately for horizontal and vertical direction. However, the sign of both values must be identical (i.e. "0.5,0" or "1.0,0.2", but not "0.2,-0.2").
  </p>

  <p>
  The sizing function can be found in the "Layers" submenu of the "Edit" menu. 
  A dialog will open that allows specification of input and output layers, sizing value in micron: 
  a single value for same sizing in x and y direction or comma-separated list of two values
  (i.e. "0.2,0.1"). 
  </p>

  <p>
  As for the boolean operations, hierarchical mode and kissing corner resolution can be specified (see 
  <link href="/manual/layer_boolean.xml"/> for a description of these modes).
  In addition, the cutoff strategy for sharp edges can be chosen from strict to virtually unlimited.
  The following screenshot demonstrates the effect for "strict" (red) to "weak" (purple) cutoff modes.
