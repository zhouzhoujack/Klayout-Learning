  <p>
  Layers can be animated, i.e. made blinking or the fill pattern scroll.
  Select the layer or the layers for which to change the animation style
  and choose the animation style from the "Animation" panel. For blinking
  mode, two phases can be selected: "Blink" and "/Blink". Choosing
  different phases for two layers makes the layers appear alternatively.
