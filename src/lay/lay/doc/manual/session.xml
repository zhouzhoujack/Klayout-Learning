  <title>Saving And Restoring A Session</title>
  <keyword name="Sessions"/>
  <keyword name="Save session"/>

  <p>
  A session can be saved and restored later. A "session" involves the files loaded, bookmarks, annotations, 
  layer settings, hierarchy settings, images and application setup. Sessions are stored as XML files with the
  suffix ".lys".
  </p>

  <p>
  To save a session, choose "Save Session" from the "File" menu. To restore a session, choose "Restore Session".
  KLayout can be started with a certain session using the "-u" option from the command line followed by the session file.
  On Windows installations, session files are registered as being opened automatically by KLayout.
