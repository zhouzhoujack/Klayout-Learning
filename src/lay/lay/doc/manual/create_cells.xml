  <title>Creating A New Cell</title>
  <keyword name="Cell"/>

  <p>
  You can create new cells using the "New Cell" function from the hierarchy panel's context menu (right mouse click on the cell hierarchy panel). 
  You are prompted to enter the new cell's name (a cell with that name must not exists yet) and a window size.
  The window size is the initial dimension of the view when the new cell is shown. Apart from that it does not
  have any meaning.
