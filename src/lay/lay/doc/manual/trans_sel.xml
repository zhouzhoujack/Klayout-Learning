  <p>
  The selection can be flipped at x- or y-axis, rotated as a whole or moved by a certain distance using the 
  functions available in the "Selection" submenu of the "Edit" menu. For example, "Flip Vertically" flips the
  selection at the x-axis. A selection can be rotated by an arbitrary angle using the "Rotation By Angle" function 
  from the "Selection" submenu.
