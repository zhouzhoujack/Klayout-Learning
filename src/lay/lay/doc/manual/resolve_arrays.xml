  <title>Resolving Arrays</title>
  <keyword name="Resolve Arrays"/>

  <p>
  Instance arrays are handy to produce large regular arrangements of cells.
  Sometimes it is necessary to resolve these arrays - for example to remove or 
  modify a single instance from the array. One way to achieve that is to create
  cell variants (see <link href="/manual/create_variants.xml"/>, but this feature
  will also create a copy of the instantiated cell.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The "Resolve Arrays" function available in "Edit/Selection" allows resolving
  of an array into individual instances which then can be edited individually.
