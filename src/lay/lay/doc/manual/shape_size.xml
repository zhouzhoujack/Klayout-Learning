  <p>
  The selected shapes can be sized with a given enlargement and shrink distance, similar to the layer operation but with less options.
  The sizing function can be found in the "Selection" submenu of the "Edit" menu. A dialog will open that prompts for the sizing value (one value for 
  same sizing in x and y direction in micron or two comma-separated values for different sizing in x and y direction).
