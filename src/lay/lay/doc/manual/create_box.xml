  <title>Creating A Box</title>
  <keyword name="Drawing"/>
  <keyword name="Box"/>

  <p>
  Select "Box" mode from the toolbar. 
  Choose a layer from the layer panel in which to create a new box. 
  Left click at the first point, move the mouse to the second point and finish the box by left-clicking at
  the second point. Press the ESC key to cancel the operation.
  </p>

  <p><b>Hint:</b> A box, once created, will remain a box. For example, it is not possible to delete one vertex 
  of it, thus forming a triangle. This is only possible for polygons.
