  <title>Technology Management</title>
  <keyword name="Technology management"/>

  <p>
  A new feature of KLayout 0.22 is technology management.
  Technology management summarizes features which require a certain interpretation of a layout.
  In particular, layout layers are assigned a physical meaning, for example via layers or active area
  layers in CMOS technologies. Since that interpretation often is depending on the technology
  the product will be fabricated with, the ability to provide multiple setups is summarized
  as "technology management".

  The "Technology Manager" in the "Tools" menu is the user interface that allows creating,
  deleting and editing of technology setups. Read more about the technology manager in
