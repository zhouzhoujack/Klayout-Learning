  <keyword name="Layout"/>

  <p>
  To start with a fresh, empty layout, choose "New" from the "File" menu.
  A form is opened that requires you to specify some basic parameters. 
  These are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Top cell:</b> this is the name of the first (and only) cell that will be present in the layout.</li>
    <li><b>Database unit:</b> this is the database unit (the conversion factor between integer coordinates
      and micron units. This is basically the "resolution" of the layout.</li>
    <li><b>Initial window size:</b> this is the size of the initial window shown, when the top cell is 
      opened the first time. Since the initial view is empty, there is no geometrical guidance. By specifying 
      an initial size, at least the "canvas" dimensions are known.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  If a default layer properties file is specified in the setup dialog ("Application" tab), 
  this is loaded into the layer view list automatically. Without such a file, the layer list is 
  empty at the beginning and layers must be created with "Layer/New" from the "Edit" menu, before any
  shapes can be drawn.
