<title>Valid And Invalid Layers</title>
<keyword name="Valid layer"/>
<keyword name="Invalid layer"/>

<p>
Starting with version 0.23, KLayout offers "invalid" layers: invalid layers can be visible, but
don't participate in selection and snapping. They just act as some kind of background drawing.
</p>

<p>
Layers can be made invalid by choosing "Make invalid" from the layer's context menu.
Layers can be made valid again by choosing "Make valid". Invalid layers are marked with a 
small "x" in the layer list.
