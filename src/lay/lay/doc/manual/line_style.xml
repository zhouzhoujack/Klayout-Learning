  <p>
  Line styles control how the outline of the shapes is drawn. 
  The default is a solid line. Available line styles are dotted lines,
  dashes lines and custom styles.
  To choose a certain line style, select the layer or the layers for which to
  change the style and choose the line style from the "Style"
  panel.
  </p>

  <p>
  New styles can be created with the "Custom Style" button. A line style editor
  will come up that allows creating and editing of new styles. The predefined
  pattern cannot be changed. To apply a new style, select "More" from the
  style selection panel and choose the new style from the list.
  The custom styles are saved with the layer display properties.
