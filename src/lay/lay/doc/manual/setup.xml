  <p>
  The option dialog available with the "Setup" function from the "File" menu offers 
  numerous configuration options from background to rulers configuration. 
  </p>

  <p>
  In this dialog for example, the color palette can be edited, so that different colors
  are available or the stipple palette can be configured. 
  In addition, it is possible to define the order how these colors or stipples are
  assigned to layers initially and which colors are not used for layer coloring.
  </p>

  <p>
  A particular useful feature is the oversampling scheme.
  Oversampling is provided as an option to enhance the image quality. The image is rendered 
  at a higher resolution and then downsampled to the screen resolution. In effect, lines appear
  thinner and more details can be resolved. As a negative side effect currently the 
  stipple pattern becomes finer and the crosses in marker mode are smaller. On the other hand
  the resolution effect can be quite impressive.
  </p>
  <p>
  Oversampling can 
  be enabled on the "Display/General" page in the setup dialog. 2x and 3x oversampling is
  provided. The following screenshots illustrate the effect of oversampling:
