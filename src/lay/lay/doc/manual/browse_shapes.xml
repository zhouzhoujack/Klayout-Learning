  <title>Browsing Shapes</title>
  <keyword name="Shape browser"/>

  <p>
  A simple shape browser allows browsing all shapes on a layer. To do
  so, select the layer or layers to browse in the layer list and choose "Browse
  shapes" from the "Tools" menu. 
  </p>
  <p>
  A browser dialog will appear that lists the cells, shapes and cell
  instances. Selecting a cell will display all shapes in the cell in the
  middle list and the cell's instances with respect to the top cell in
  the right list. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If a shape is selected, the layout canvas highlights this shape by
  drawing a marker box around the shape and zooming to the shape. How the 
  shape is shown can be configured on the "Configure" tab of the shape
  browser dialog or on the respective page in the "Setup" dialog.
  </p>

  <p>
  Another feature that among many other things allows inspection of shapes 
  is the "Search and replace" function (see <link href="/manual/search_replace.xml"/>).
