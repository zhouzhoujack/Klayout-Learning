  <p>
  "Partial editing" is a powerful feature that allows modification of shapes. Edges or segments
  of polygons resp. paths can be moved, vertices, edges or segments from polygons or paths can be deleted and 
  new points can be inserted into polygons and paths. "Partial editing" can be applied to a complex partial selection: 
  Multiple edges or vertices can be selected and deleted or moved.
  </p>

  <p>
  The normal selection works "full element". In this mode, the whole shape is being moved or deleted. 
  Only in full element mode, shapes or instances can be sent to the clipboard.
