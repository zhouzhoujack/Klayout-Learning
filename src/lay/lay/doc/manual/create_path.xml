  <p>
  Select "Path" mode from the toolbar. The editor options dialog will open that additionally prompts for 
  basic path parameters, such as width and extension scheme. When a path is being drawn, it will receive
  the settings entered into this dialog. The path properties can even be changed, while the path is 
  being drawn. Don't forget to click "Apply" to take over the current entries. If the dialog has been
  closed unintentionally, it can be reopened with the F3 shortcut.
  </p>

  <p>
  To actually draw a path, 
  choose a layer from the layer panel in which to create a new box. 
  Left click at the first vertex, move the mouse to the second vertex, click to place this one and continue 
  to the last vertex. Double-click at the last vertex to finish the path. Press the ESC key to cancel the operation.
  </p>

  <p>
  For paths, as for polygons, the segments created are subject to certain direction restrictions as 
  imposed by the connection angle constraints. 
  See <link href="/manual/editor_options.xml"/> 
  for a detailed description of the modes. Use the "editor options" dialog (F3 shortcut) to change the mode,
  also during editing.
