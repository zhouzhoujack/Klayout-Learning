  <title>Browsing Instances</title>
  <keyword name="Instance browser"/>

  <p>
  All instances of a cell can be browsed by selecting the cell in the cell 
  list (not making it the new top), and choosing "Browse instances" from the "Tools"
  menu. A simple instance browser comes up that shows all cells that the
  given cell is instantiated in and how the cell is instantiated.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  Another feature that among many other things allows inspection of instances 
  is the "Search and replace" function (see <link href="/manual/search_replace.xml"/>).
