  <title>Changing The Display Style</title>

  <p>
  The line width of the element's frame can be changed by using the width
  buttons on the "Style" panel after having selected the layers to apply
  the change on. "0px" removes the line, "1px" draws a single-pixel wide
  line (the default), "2px" a somewhat thicker line and so on. 
  </p>

  <p>
  "Simple" is the normal draw mode while "Marked" draws a cross on each
  vertex of the element. The cross size is constant so the shapes stay
  visible even on large scale where the elements would otherwise become
  single pixels.
  </p>

  <p>
  A layer can be configured to draw a diagonal cross on rectangles. 
  To enable this style, select "Cross" from 
  the "Styles" toolbox. To disable it, choose "No Cross". The cross 
  drawing will add to the fill pattern and applies to rectangles only.
