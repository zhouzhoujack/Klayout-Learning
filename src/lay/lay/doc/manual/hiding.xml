  <title>Hiding Cells</title>
  <keyword name="Hide cells"/>

  <p>
  Independent of the hierarchy levels shown, cells can be hidden. In this case, the 
  cell is now shown but rather the bounding box is shown. To do so, select the cell from
  the cell list and choose "Hide" from the context menu. To show a cell again, choose
  "Show". To make all cells visible again, choose "Show All".
