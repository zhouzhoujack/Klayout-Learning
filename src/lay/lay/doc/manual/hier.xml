  <title>Choosing A Hierarchy Depth</title>
  <keyword name="Hierarchy depth"/>
  <keyword name="Display"/>

  <p>
  By default, only the bounding box of the cell selected is shown. This
  corresponds to zero hierarchy levels being shown. If you select one more
  level of hierarchy (Levels 0 to 1), this content of the child cells of
  the current cell are drawn, but grandchildren (children of child cells)
  are drawn as boxes. Increasing the hierarchy levels will draw more 
  and more details of child cells until all cells below the current 
  cell are drawn in detail.
