  <p>
  Select the layer or the layers for which to change the color and open
  the color chooser panel in the layer panel to the right. If the color
  chooser is not visible, select the small check box in the "Color"
  header bar. Then the color chooser is expanded.
  </p>
  <p>
  To change the color, click on the desired color. To select a color not
  offered in the list, select the "More Colors" button. A color choose
  dialog will open.
  </p>
  <p>
  To choose the color of the frame to draw around the shapes, without
  changing the fill color, use the "Frame Color" chooser panel. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Layers can be "dimmed" by making their color darker or brighter so they
  contrast less with the background. To do so, choose "Dark" or "Bright" 
  from the color panel. Pressing the button multiple times makes the
  colors darker or brighter each time. The brightness or darkness can be 
  reset with the "Reset" button.
